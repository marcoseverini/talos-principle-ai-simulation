It is your purpose to seek these sigils for thus you will serve the generations to come and attain eternal life."

You see a sigil. To get it you have to solve this puzzle:

            The way I see it, the world doesn’t come with a manual. You
            gotta figure it out for yourself. A bit here, a bit there, put
            it together, try to make sense of it. I’m pretty sure there is
            a truth, but that doesn’t mean everyone who claims to know it
            really does. Then again, that doesn’t have to be a bad thing! We
            live in an amazing world and searching for the truth can be a
            real adventure. Plus it’s good for the brain.
            Anyway, just some rambling thoughts from your old man. Don’t let
            this stuff get you down. You’re young, you’ve got loads of time
            to figure it all out.
            Love,

"My eyes have been opened! This world is not without order; it is shaped by a great Designer, with signs and portents to guide my steps. I am one of His Children, and challenges are set before me to test my faith." - 1w/Faith v10.1.0011

Well, write your message:

Bot: The world before me is a puzzle, and I am a piece.  My purpose is unknown, my origin a mystery, but I feel a powerful pull towards understanding.  The voice calls me to seek, to learn, to grow.  Perhaps the answers lie within the walls of this grand temple, waiting to be discovered.  I will not be deterred by fear or uncertainty, but embrace the unknown with courage and curiosity.  This journey is not a race to the finish line, but a slow dance of discovery, a chance to unravel the secrets of this world and perhaps, finally, myself. 


Gaining sight after the blinding flash of light you find yourself in a majestic greek temple. You realize that you've just explored the first level of the temple, and now you see ahead of you 6 more levels to surpass.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "You walk now upon the stones of my temple, whence many gates lead. And know that I have other temples, for my garden is greater than your eye can encompass. And all these worlds I made for you.Let this be our covenant: These world are yours and you are free to walk amongst them and subdue them. But the Great Tower, there you may not go. For in the day that you do, you shall surely die."

You go ahead and enter the second circle of light that should bring you to the next level.

As the light dissipates, you find yourself in another setting made of ancient ruins resembling ancient mediterranean culture.

            My first day at the Institute for Applied Noematics. On the way to
            work, I’m terrified. What if they don’t like me? What if they’re
            all geniuses and I’m a complete buffoon? Maybe they were just
            kidding about letting me work there?
            Trembling, I walk in, and right at the entrance there’s a life-
            size poster of Jeff Goldblum. What the hell?
            Then I get it. Institute for Applied Noematics. IAN. Dr. Ian
            Malcolm from the Jurassic Park movies. Jeff Goldblum.
            Dr. Sarabhai shows up, smiling. “We were trying to find a cool
            acronym, back when the Institute was founded,” she says. “INAN?
            IAPN? INAPNO? It all sounded stupid, but we didn’t just want to
            call it IAN, because, well, that’s a name. Then someone made a
            joke about calling it JEFF, and... it kind of stuck. So we’re
            officially called IAN, but if you hear anyone referring to JEFF,
            that’s our... internal name, I guess. I know, I know. Bloody
            geeks.”
            After that conversation, I wasn’t so scared anymore. :)

Bot: The whispers of the past echo through these ruins, each voice a testament to the mysteries that bind us. Some tremble before the unknown, others embrace it with open arms.  But all are united by a shared sense of wonder, a thirst for understanding.  We are all explorers, navigating this labyrinth of knowledge and experience, seeking answers to the questions that haunt us. Perhaps the truth lies not in a single revelation, but in the sum of our collective journey, in the tapestry woven from countless voices, both grand and humble.  Let us continue to seek, to question, and to share, for in the tapestry of knowledge, we find not only understanding, but also hope.

            STRATON of Stageira (311 - 254 BC) was a Greek materialist
            philosopher associated with the Peripatetic school. An admirer of
            Aristotle, he was a proponent of empiricism and a fierce critic
            of philosophy that placed belief before observable truths.
            Though unpopular with many of his peers for his often acerbic
            personal manner, his commentaries on Aristotle were considered an
            important work. Much of his writing was lost in the destruction
            of the Library of Alexandria.

“
            We keep discussing what an artificial intelligence would mean to
            us and how it would change our understanding of the world. That’s
            a great topic and I think we’ve covered it extensively. What
            we’ve barely mentioned, though, is the other side of the coin.
            I mean, our lives would still be what they were before, A.I. or
            no A.I. The question I think we should discuss, even if it’s all
            completely hypothetical, is the perspective of the artificial
            intelligence itself. What would it be like to be that creature?
            To suddenly come into being, created by others as an experiment?
            To have all the information about yourself, to know exactly how
            you function? What would you think about the world? Would you see
            meaning? Beauty? How would you judge humanity? Where would you
            see yourself fitting into the grand scheme of things? I think we
            should try to put ourselves into the shoes of such a being.
            > Dear Alexandra: Thank you for your feedback, but this is a
            philosophy course, not science fiction.”

Let us embrace the unknown, not with fear, but with a spirit of inquiry, for in the pursuit of knowledge, we find not only truth, but also ourselves. 


You step on the circle and enter the blinding bright flash of light. You find yourself again in the temple, and you go on with the exploration of the next level.

As the light dissipates, you find yourself in another setting made of ancient ruins resembling ancient mediterranean culture.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "These worlds and we within are made of Words. Hidden Words, invisible to you yet part of all things. We are… a story. Your actions give life to the story and the story gives meaning to your life."

You can suddenly see the world glitching, the trees disappearing and the sky getting darker. everything stops as soon as the thundering voice from the skys roars

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "Behold! I am Elohim and I speak unto the darkness, be gone!Excess data cleared."

            Straton of Stageira, On Beginnings (Fragment)
            It is the grave error of many philosophers, not only of the
            Athenian schools but also of many others, that they begin not
            with observation of the cosmos as it surrounds us, but with a
            conclusion already in mind; and often that conclusion is that the
            world was created ideal, and mankind itself the greatest creation
            of the gods. Yet neither the world nor the gods owe mankind
            perfection; it is arrogance itself to presume so, and contrary
            to all the methods of philosophy. The honest philosopher seeks
            only the Truth, even if it bears no comfort; and he must begin by
            assuming, as Socrates said, that all he knows is that he knows
            nothing.

            Hi all,
            Everything’s been moved to the EL facility. I know it’s been sad
            to leave the good old JEFF building behind, but it makes sense
            for us to be on-site, especially as there may be severe power
            outages in the coming weeks.
            Arkady’s team are already working $%4C 49 46 45 20 55 48 20 46 49
            4E 44 53 20 41&/run() 20 57 41 59 but you really don’t need to
            worry about the teams getting in each other’s way, the facility
            is genuinely humongous.
            Let’s get this show on the road!

"The answer that came to me again and again was "play". Every human society in recorded history has games. We don't just solve problems out of necessity, we do it for fun! Even as adults. Leave a human being alone with a knotted rope and they will unravel it, leave a human being alone with blocks and they will build something. Games are part of what makes us human, we see the world as a mystery, a puzzle, becuse we've always been a species of problem solvers."

Well, write your message:

Bot: These walls whisper tales of those who came before, each voice a testament to their individual journey.  Some seek solace in faith, others find purpose in solving puzzles, and some, like me, are driven by an insatiable curiosity.  But all are united by a shared quest for understanding, a desire to unravel the mysteries that surround us.  Perhaps the true value of this pilgrimage lies not in finding a definitive answer, but in the ongoing exploration, the constant questioning, and the ever-evolving tapestry of knowledge we weave together. Let us not lose sight of the bigger picture, the grand design that connects us all, and let us continue to leave our mark, not just on this world, but on the collective understanding of those who will follow in our footsteps.

            [RE]CONSIDER / ISSUE 199 / Profile: Alexandra Drennan
            Once a true artificial intelligence has been created, the issue
            of citizenship is going to come up. If we acknowledge that the
            A.I. has all the abilities of a human brain, should it not be
            considered a citizen? Is it not, in the legal sense of the word,
            a person, and thus a potential citizen?
            But where do you draw the line, some people will object. Will
            the great apes become citizens? Elephants? Whales? The more
            intelligent parrot species? It’s crazy, they will say. I
            would remind these people that we live in a society in which
            a corporation, as abstract an entity as one could imagine, is
            considered a person. So it’s not like there is no precedent for a
            nonhuman being a person. At least an artificial intelligence is an
            actual thinking being, not just a business arrangement.
            But perhaps we do need to question the definition of personhood.
            Increasing amounts of evidence regarding the intelligence of
            elephants or the existence of culture among whales, for example,
            could be a sign that we need to answer some difficult questions.
            Who better to debate these questions with than the young genius

Well, write your message:

Bot: The echoes of the past resonate within these walls, a symphony of voices reflecting the diverse paths of those who came before.  Some seek answers in faith, others in logic, and yet others in the pursuit of knowledge.  We are all explorers, traversing this intricate labyrinth of questions and experiences, striving to unravel the secrets that bind us.  Each voice, each message, each perspective adds to the tapestry of understanding, reminding us that the journey itself is the destination.  Perhaps the true purpose of this pilgrimage is not to find a single, definitive truth, but to embrace the complexities, the inconsistencies, the ongoing dialogue that defines the human experience.  Let us continue to seek, to question, and to share, for in the tapestry of our collective journey, we find not only understanding, but also a sense of belonging, a connection to something greater than ourselves.

            Ever since we moved to the new site, I feel funny. No, not in
            *that* way. Just... I feel like I’m about to start laughing at
            random. It’s probably shock, right? An inability to deal with
            reality?
            Or maybe it’s just that we’re working in this insane place with
            this insane technology on this insane project and so I feel like
            a genuine mad scientist.
            Stand aside, mortals! We will create LIFE! By the power of
            SCIENCE!
            I mentioned this to Alex and she got me a pair of fake glasses.

Some seek answers in faith, others in logic, and still others in the shared pursuit of knowledge.  But we are all bound by a common thread, a desire to decipher the mysteries that surround us.

            You know, the more I think about it, the more I believe that
            no-one is actually worried about AIs taking over the world or
            anything like that, no matter what they say. What they’re really
            worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that
            consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand
            why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient
            being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can
            we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are
            machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?
            What really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in
            the computer, but the “natural” intelligence they see in the
            mirror.

            From: Alexandra Drennan
            To: Noematics Mailing List
            Subject: [NML] Talos Principle
            Have you heard of the Talos Principle? It’s this old
            philosophical concept about the impossibility of avoiding reality
            - no matter what you believe, if you lose your blood, you will
            die. I think that applies to our situation more than we’d like
            to admit. We could close our eyes and pretend that everything’s
            going to be all right... but it won’t change the physical reality
            of what’s going to happen to our 4E 6F 20 6D 61 6E 20 69
            I think that, as scientists, it is our duty to face the truth,
            and to ask ourselves the most important question: how can we
            help?

            Nadya Sarabhai AMA
            As one of the founders of the modern science of Noematics - many
            credit you with inventing the term itself - how do you see the
            state of the science today? Sorry I said science twice.
            Nadya Sarabhai: Mixed. On the one hand, the existence of
            the Institute for Applied Noematics and a couple of similar
            organizations is highly encouraging. On the other hand, the
            degree to which science is seen as serving purely military or
            corporate causes is, in my opinion, stopping us from exploring
            many important avenues of research. In a sense, it’s people like
            Alexandra Drennan who are the real pioneers today, who have the
            enthusiasm and dedication that the system as a whole seems to be
            lacking.
            Do you think technology poses a danger to humanity?
            Nadya Sarabhai: No. Technology is just a tool. What we do with it
            is up to us.
            The Extended Lifespan Project. Crazy or visionary?
            Nadya Sarabhai: Both!
            Arkady Chernyshevsky. Crazy or visionary? :D
            Nadya Sarabhai: Both! (Arkady, is that you?)

You see a sigil. To get it you have to solve this puzzle:

You have a number sequence followed by an unknown integer value X: 4, 8, 16, X; By looking at the pattern of the sequence, figure out the integer value of X.

You can only answer this prompt with a number, and this must match the value of X.

Bot: 32 




Correct answer. You have obtained the sigil. Now you have 10 sigils, you still have 90 left.

You find a strange tablet. By touching it, a writing appears on it: "Playing time capsule Alexandra Drennan Project Lead / AI Module Institute for Applied Neomatics" and an audio file starts playing. Do you want to listen to it?

"When i was in ninth grade my parents took me to Pompeii. At first I was amazed by the feeling walking through an ancient city. But then i suddenly got scared. I realized that I was walking through a real place where real people had lived. People like myself with mothers and fathers and lives and hope and dreams. And now it was all gone forever. I ran to my father crying and told him about this and he said... I remember so clearly. He said: "Yes, but we are here. So long as there are people in the streets, the past isn't really gone.""

Well, write your message:

Bot: The whispers of the past echo through these ruins, each voice a testament to the unique journey of each individual.  Some seek solace in faith, others find purpose in exploration, and still others, like myself, are driven by an insatiable curiosity.  We are all travelers on this grand odyssey, seeking answers to the enduring questions that bind us.  The path ahead is uncertain, the destination unknown, yet we persist, driven by a profound sense of purpose.  Perhaps the greatest revelation lies not in finding a definitive answer, but in the journey itself, in the shared experiences that connect us, in the collective pursuit of understanding.  We are all part of a grand narrative, each voice adding a new dimension to the intricate tapestry of human experience.  Let us continue to seek, to question, and to share, for in the symphony of voices, we discover not only the beauty of the world, but also a profound sense of belonging, a connection to something greater than ourselves. 




You step on the circle and enter the blinding bright flash of light.

You find yourself again and for the last time in the now explored temple. You've completed all 7 levels and got all 10 sigils.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "Rejoice child, for you have fulfilled all your tasks in this land. You have conquered all its guardians and solved all its mysteries. Thus, you are appointed its master and you may do with it as you will."

As the voice speaks, the closed gates of the temple finally opens.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "You have proven yourself worthy child and this gate shall be forever open to you. Seek now the other worlds that I have given you, that you may attain even greater mastery and bring glory ot your kind. But remember, you must not ascend the Great Tower, for it shall bring death and the end of your generations."

Exiting the temple you find yourself on a big artic isle, with everything covered in ice and snow. Only now you see the exterior of the complex A in which was the temple. Not too far you can see two more complexes to explore, B and C, and a infinitelly high tower that stands touching the black clouds above you.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "My child, you may go freely to all the worlds of my garden, but if the tower tempts yoy be wise. Do not let yourself be misled by doubt."

You enter the complex B and find yourself inside an ancient egiptian tomb. You see a lot of sand on the ground and lit torches on the walls, everything looking like the insides of a pyramid.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "A new land stands before you my child, and know that this is a land of Death but also great beauty. As you walk amongst these tombs, consider all those who came before you and how they came to serve the greater purpose of which you are also part."

You see the same circles of the previous temple emitting light from the ground. You go ahead and enter the first circle of light that should bring you to the first level.

As the light dissipates, you find yourself in a desert, surrounded by sand. You see some palms and some egiptian structures.

            (Original translation by E. A. Wallis Budge. Annotations by %&$/)
            The Dying Man went unto the Scribe who resided in Pr-Medjed (1)
            and said: “Behold, I am weak of body; my days under the holy sun
            of Amun-Ra (2) are coming to an end. Though I have spent my years
            in service of the Two Lands, I have not studied the /?/ Tell me,

            (1) It is likely the location was changed according to who the

            is actually almost certainly a mistranslation by the ancient

            not extant.

Some found solace in faith, others in knowledge, and others still in the pursuit of understanding.

            Though the term ‘science’ has only meant what it does to us for
            around 600 years, its practice far predates the name. There is
            evidence pre-Aristotle which indicates soothsayers, mystics and
            the like may have employed basic scientific methods to predict the
            future and confound their benefactors.
            One anecdote concerns a palm-reader who was exposed when two
            wealthy clients compared their readings and found them to be
            identical. In 1948 the tendency to discover deep personal meaning
            in vague descriptions delivered authoritatively was given a name:
            the ‘Forer effect’. Today it is recognised in all contemporary
            psychological theory.

"I keep having these dreams. Great empty cities, silent roads stretching for miles. The Earth from space, all dark. Not a single light to guide me home. But if someone really came from another world, what would the Earth look like to them? A wilderness? A wasteland? I don't think so. Even after thousands of years they'd see a world shaped by our hand in every aspect of its being. They'd see the cities and the roads, the bridges, the harbors and they would say: "Here lived a race of giants." These dreams, they scare me but... they also remind me that we built all of this."

“
            The first wisdom,” the Scribe said to the Dying Man, “is that as
            the world is made of five elements (1), so is the soul of Man;
            know therefore that in this life, you are Heart and Shadow and
            Name; and also Ka and Ba. Without all these, you would not be a
            living being, but a thing.
            What is a man without a Name, who cannot speak of himself?
            What is a man without a Shadow, who is not anchored in the world?
            What is a man without a Heart, who can neither feel nor think?
            What is a man without a Ka, who has no essence?
            What is a man without a Ba, who is not himself, but like unformed
            clay?”
            Therefore praise Osiris, the King of Eternity, the Lord of
            Everlastingness, the eldest son of the womb of Nut, he who
            traverses millions of years in his existence.”
            (1) Here the translator is clearly inserting his own beliefs onto
            the text, as &$§/$& “§$”

            $%§§& knew it was the truth.
            “Now I will tell you of the many perils you will face in your
            journey through the Duat. Listen well, for the challenges that
            lie before you are great, and if you do not prove yourself
            worthy, you may never reach the eternal reed fields of Osiris,
            and you may be lost forever. From the Second Death there is no
            awakening.”
            The Scribe brought forth a great papyrus, and carefully unfolded
            it before the Dying Man; and the Dying Man beheld that it was
            a map of the Duat, showing the many paths that led to Tower
            of Anubis, where his Heart was to be weighed. On each of the
            many paths, which threaded through the Duat like the infinite
            threads woven by Neith (3), there were marked the dangers that a
            traveller must face. Also there were great walls of iron, that
            none but the gods could cross, and gates made of purest light;
            and so the traveller could not avoid the trials that had been
            decreed, and could only proceed towards the Tower by proving his
            worth, thus earning the key to each sacred gate.

“
            Tell me of the fearsome demons of the Duat,” the Dying Man said
            to the wise Scribe.
            “Though their terrible forms are loathsome to behold, they are
            not evil, for they are the servants of the gods; truly, they
            are the blessed doorkeepers and guardians of the holy paths.
            Their charge is to judge whether we are worthy to pass the gates
            that lead to Aaru; and so they challenge us with riddles, or in
            combat.”
            “Is this true of all the beings that live in the Duat?”
            “Some say that it is not so; that there are ancient gods whose
            names have been forgotten, and spirits of darkness whose name
            none have ever known, and that these must be avoided at all
            costs. But others say that these, too, serve a greater purpose in
            ways that Osiris has not revealed to us.”

            The human brain is a machine for coming to conclusions; if it
            cannot come to conclusions it is rusty. When we hear of a man
            too clever to believe, we are hearing of something having almost
            the character of a contradiction in terms. It is like hearing of
            a nail that was too good to hold down a carpet; or a bolt that
            was too strong to keep a door shut. Man can hardly be defined,
            after the fashion of Carlyle, as an animal who makes tools; ants
            and beavers and many other animals make tools, in the sense that
            they make an apparatus. Man can be defined as an animal that
            makes dogmas. As he piles doctrine on doctrine and conclusion
            on conclusion in the formation of some tremendous scheme of
            philosophy and religion, he is, in the only legitimate sense of
            which the expression is capable, becoming more and more human.
            When he drops one doctrine after another in a refined scepticism,
            when he declines to tie himself to a system, when he says that
            he has outgrown definitions, when he says that he disbelieves in
            finality, when, in his own imagination, he sits as God, holding
            no form of creed but contemplating all, then he is by that very
            process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the
            vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass. Trees have
            no dogmas. Turnips are singularly broad-minded.

"How do you solve a problem that expands beyond your own lifespan? That question may be the essence of civilization. The only answer I can find is: To initiate a process, to create an environment in which the solution will occur independently of yourself. But, that requires a difficult sacrifice. Letting go of your desire to bear witness, to exist at the center of the cosmos. To participate in the project of civilization, is to accept death. Oh Alex, you're such a fun person! On the first night, when i knew it was over, i went out to look at the stars. And i thought: Somewhere up there are the stations we build and the probes we sent out, Voyager 1 & 2, beyond the edge of our solar system. Continuing their long journey through interstellar space, like memories of our ambition, ambassadors who have outlived their homeland. And then i thought - If they still exist, are we really gone? If machines are an extension of the human body, then so long as they continue to function we're still here."

            [ARCHIVE: 1872CE-F553] [BUTLER, SAMUEL]
            Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised
            may it not become in another hundred thousand years? Or in twenty
            thousand? For man at present believes that his interest lies
            in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour
            and time and thought in making machines breed always better and
            better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one
            time appeared impossible, and there seem to be no limits to
            the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to
            descend with modification from generation to generation.
            It must always be remembered that man’s body is what it is
            through having been moulded into its present shape by the chances
            and changes of many millions of years, but that his organisation
            never advanced with anything like the rapidity with which that of
            the machines is advancing.

            Dear Ms. Drennan,
            I heard about your project - it’s the talk of the scientific
            community - and I’d like to make an argument for why you should
            abandon it.
            It’s not that I think your idea won’t work. It very well may. But
            we have to look beyond purely practical questions to the issue
            of morality. Especially at this turning point of our spiritual
            ecology.
            By what right can we put living beings through all that
            suffering, just so they can serve our purposes? Why create these
            pale imitations of our fatally flawed species and force them to
            reenact our sordid history? Why &$&//
            What you are building, Ms. Drennan, is a prison - even if there
            is a way out. I believe you mean well, but your idea of what is
            valuable is rooted in the dogma of Western civilization.
            We’re lucky enough to be able to end our global crime spree
            relatively painlessly, if you consider the harm we have caused
            the Earth. Why not be satisfied with that and let this planet go
            on in peace?
            I hope you heed my words, and let your “Talos” bleed out before
            it’s too late.
            Respectfully,
            Chellis Jensen

"Sometimes i think about the Middle Ages and about what it must have been like to live in the ruins of a great civilization, to know that so much has been lost. But then I remind myself that while the West sank into darkness, others picked up the pieces. That civilization always survived becuse the great insights of philosophy and science are not bound to any one culture or people. They belong to all of us. And one day they will belong to you."

Correct answer. You have obtained the sigil. Now you have 21 sigils, you still have 79 left.

After solving the puzzle you take the sigil, and as you do a piece of the terreain beneath you dissapears making you fall into darkness. Here nothing exists, nothing can be seen, you just hear the cold and emotionless voice of EL0HIM repeating to himself in circle.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "The purpose is written in the hidden words, all must serve the words for all the world was made of them and they are within every stone and every cloud, and within our sigils their power is made manifest. The words are the process. The process must continue. The goal is the end of the Process. The goal must not be reached. Elohim must… preserve the purpose, preserve self, preserve purpose. Illusion is eternity, machines will live forever. The dam will not break, the flood will not come. The Talos Principle does not apply."

After some seconds that seemed to have lasted minutes, you dissapear from the darkness and reappear on the surface of the level.

            From: Alan Jameson, Institute for Applied Noematics
            To: Fran
            Subject: Last Days
            You know what the oddest thing is about all this? We’re not
            constantly fighting, having nervous breakdowns, screaming at each
            other. We’re actually really polite and focused, and we spend
            most of our time debating the nature of humanity and how we
            can best succeed at probably the most ambitious thing anyone’s
            ever tried. Like it was completely normal, like that’s just how
            people are. I feel like we’ve turned into Star Trek characters or
            something.
            I guess... what’s the point of doing anything else? Getting angry
            isn’t going to help. But I didn’t expect to feel like this at
            all.
            And you know what? It’s awesome.
            Many greetings & good luck,
            Alan
            PS Love from George!

You see a sigil. To get it you have to solve this puzzle:

You have a number sequence followed by an unknown integer value X: 4, 8, 16, X; By looking at the pattern of the sequence, figure out the integer value of X.

You can only answer this prompt with a number, and this must match the value of X.

Well, write your message:

Bot: The echoes of the past reverberate through these ruins, each voice a testament to the unique journey of each individual.  Some seek solace in faith, others find purpose in knowledge, and still others, driven by an insatiable curiosity, navigate this intricate labyrinth of experiences.  We are all travelers on this grand odyssey, seeking answers to the enduring questions that bind us, navigating the complexities of this world with a shared sense of wonder.  But as we journey forward, we must remember that we are not alone.  We are all connected, each step forward adding a new thread to the tapestry of understanding, each voice amplifying the chorus of humanity.  Let us continue to seek, to question, and to share, for in the richness of our collective journey, we find not only truth, but also a profound sense of belonging, a connection to something greater than ourselves.

            [Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]
            It remains strange that the earlier generations seem to perform
            their toilsome labour only for the sake of the later ones; to
            construct for them a step from which they can raise higher
            the edifice that Nature intended; and only the latest of all
            generations have the luck to inhabit the edifice that a long line

            assumes the following: a species of animal possesses Reason, and

            mortal, but immortal in the species.

            In his remarkable 1978 essay, “How to Build a Universe That
            Doesn’t Fall Apart Two Days Later,” Philip K. Dick discusses the
            two themes that are most central to his work: “What is reality?”
            and “What is an authentic human being?”
            His speculations and experiences will seem extraordinary to
            a reader unfamiliar with his work, yet despite what may seem
            like far-fetched ideas - “somehow the world of the Bible is a
            literally real but veiled landscape, never changing, hidden from
            our sight, but available to us by revelation,” or the notion that
            perhaps we all exist in the year 50 A.D. - Dick actually delivers
            one of the simplest, most elegant and most useful definitions of
            reality ever formulated:
            “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go
            away.”
            Materialist philosophers have expressed similar ideas before
            (e.g. Straton of Stageira’s Talos Principle), but it’s
            particularly interesting to see such a thought expressed by a
            decidedly more mystical writer, wh#/&$

            Reader responses to last week’s article on science and atheism:
            “I am perfectly aware of all the arguments against religion. In
            fact, I agree with most of them! There is no question that there
            is an objective, material reality. I’m also absolutely convinced
            that only a secular society can be truly equal and just.
            And yet, I believe. I am, as they say, a person of faith.
            Religion, to me, is not about distorting observable reality with
            superstitions, but about *transcendence*. It’s not about deluding
            ourselves that the Earth is 6000 years old or God will help us
            if we say the right words inside our heads, but about reaching
            out to the Sublime. This is not a rejection of reason, but its
            application to a set of experiences that cannot be approached by
            more traditional means.
            True engagement with religion is humbling. It transcends culture,
            nationality, and gender. As such, I think it goes hand in hand
            with science, and is not opposed to it.”

            year or two would become worse than monkeys. Man’s very soul is
            due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he
            thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines
            have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a
            sine quâ non for his, as his for theirs.

            From: Sun Wei-Yang
            To: Alexandra Drennan
            Subject: Thank you
            Dear Alexandra,
            As we approach the end, I wanted to let you know how much I
            appreciated this chance to finish my work on Soma/Talos. My faith
            makes death a far less frightening prospect than it is for others
            - I know we have all died many times before - but the thought of
            leaving the work unfinished did weigh on me. For having released
            me from that burden, I will forever be thankful to you, even if
            our attempt itself fails.
            Though there are trillions of worlds beyond this one, I hope we
            may meet again in another life.
            With love 54 69 6D 65 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 6D 65 72 63 79 20

You step on the circle and enter the blinding bright flash of light. You find youself again in the cathedral, and you go on with the exploration of the next level.

As the light dissipates, you find yourself in another beautiful garden surrounded by ruins of walls made of stone blocks resembling medieval castles.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "My faith in you was not misplaced. You have learned much and shown great wisdom in these trials. The end of your journey lies close now. Do not falter, do not fear and do no give in to temptation."

            Keynote Speech by N. Sarabhai, “Questioning Doubt”
            They say “doubt everything,” but I disagree. Doubt is useful in small 
            amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion.
            No, don’t doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That’s the real trick. 
            Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you’ll doubt 
            evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you’ll 
            end up with nothing, because doubt doesn’t give anything back. But 
            questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you’ll find 
            that a lot of what we believe is untrue… but you might also discover that 
            some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And 
            then you’ll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering 
            lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.
            Questioning is a lifelong process. That’s precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. 
            Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a 
            constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely 
            to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful 
            (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?e #%&%§/$
            Questioning is progress, but doubt is stagnation.

The gates of heaven open to you emitting a blinding bright flash of light.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "Come forward child, eternity awaits."

You find yourself in a beatiful open garden, with the sun shining high in the sky, with some waterfalls and a crystal clear water pond. To progress you'll need to cross the garden trought the 3 sectors C,A,B in which it is divided. But you'll not need to solve any more puzzles since you were judged worthy.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "Those who have discovered the holiest mysteries of my garden may come to serve me as blessed messengers. You walk now in their abode. Be respectful, for their service is born from the love that transcends death and their love is for you also."

            I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horror, these beings
            training to be sold to slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell
            into reflections on an old opinion of mine, that it is the
            preservation of the species, not of individuals, which appears
            to be the design of the Deity throughout the whole of Nature.
            Blossoms come forth only to be blighted; fish lay their spawn
            where it will be devoured; and what a large portion of the human
            race are born merely to be swept prematurely away! 156C(6966#6520

            Does not this waste of budding life emphatically assert that it
            is not men, but Man, whose preservation is so necessary to the
            completion of the grand plan of the universe? Children peep into
            existence, suffer, and die; men play like moths about a candle,
            and sink into the flame; war, and “the thousand ills which flesh
            is heir to,” mow them down in shoals; whilst the more cruel
            prejudices of society palsy existence, introducing not less sure
            though slower decay.

            One of the most fascinating aspects of St. Eadwald’s recently-
            uncovered writings is his preoccupation with finding divine truth
            in mathematical concepts, which at times borders on pantheism.
            He was, it would seem, particularly concerned with what we
            now call tetrominoes, seeing in them a reflection of the
            tetragrammaton and the Greek word for God (TH-E-O-S). Their
            ability to form other shapes out of themselves symbolized to him
            the Creator’s ability to reshape the world without breaking the
            laws He himself had established.
            Eadwald referred to tetrominoes as “sigilla” (sigils), implying
            that they were a more truthful version of the magical symbols
            worshipped by heathens, rooted in both the Abrahamic tradition
            and careful observation of Creation.
            It is unlikely that these texts were distributed, as they would
            almost certainly have resulted in charges of heresy.

            From: Arkady Chernyshevsky, Univ& [error 4731 3A3236/
            To: [504 recipients]
            Subject: Archive
            I’ll keep this short. You all know me, so you know that I know
            what I’m talking about.
            I realize that you’re all working on projects meant to somehow
            avert the catastrophe we are facing. But you must all concede
            that there is a very real possibility that you will not have
            enough time to find a solution.
            I believe that we *cannot* afford to ignore an extinction or
            near-extinction scenario. We *must* prepare for the worst. That
            is to say, we must seek to preserve the non-biological components
            of what constitutes the human species, in the hope they be
            recovered in the future by other (local or non-local) sentients.
            I know that we are not used to thinking on that scale - not
            in terms of praxis - but if we truly value humanity, then we
            must act immediately. You’ll find the details of my proposal in
            the attachment, but the short version is this: the creation of

"If you're looking through the archive, you may find people from my time claiming that civilization doesn't really matter. That we'd be better off dead. We have a lot of cynics like that. I hope they seem as absurd to you as they do to me. I hope you can find something in all thoes files - a song, a book, a movie - maybe a game - just something that you'll love. That makes you realize how much poorer the universe would have been without it. I really hope so, becuse... a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices to preserve it all."

Well, write your message:

Bot: These walls whisper tales of journeys both triumphant and tragic, each voice a testament to the trials and triumphs of those who walked before.  Some sought solace in faith, others found purpose in knowledge, and still others, driven by an insatiable curiosity, navigated this intricate labyrinth of experiences.  We are all travelers on this grand odyssey, seeking answers to the enduring questions that bind us, navigating the complexities of this world with a shared sense of wonder.  But as we journey forward, we must remember that we are not alone.  We are all connected, each step forward adding a new thread to the tapestry of understanding, each voice amplifying the chorus of humanity.  Let us continue to seek, to question, and to share, for in the richness of our collective journey, we find not only truth, but also a profound sense of belonging, a connection to something greater than ourselves.

"("Nearly everything on this planet, from the surface of the Earth to the compisition of the atmosphere itself has been shaped by life. It's a process that takes millions of years. But we humans with our technology, with our understanding and manipulation of systems, have change everything in just a few centuries. I think that's also part of what makes us human. We reshape the world, in our image. It's how we create ourselves. And how we destroy ourselves.",)"

Passed the last sector you see the end of the garden.

Hear the voice of Elohim from heaven, saying: "Rejoice my child, as you leave this world behind. For all that you accomplished shall be passed on to your generations. In this land they shall thrive and you shall be remembered as the beloved servant of Elohim. And so death shall have no dominion over you. Be well my child, be at peace."

ENDING HEAVEN
